# CYAxiverse

This project wraps some functions in [CYTools](https://cytools.liammcallistergroup.com/) to generate multi-axion systems derived directly from Type IIB string theory compactified on orientifolded Calabi-Yau geometries which are triangulations of polytopes in the [Kreuzer-Skarke Database](http://hep.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~kreuzer/CY/).

The package then generates a variety of axion statistics for these systems including:
- masses
- decay constants
- quartic interactions
- number of vacua
- coordinates of vacua

> :warning: This package is very much a work-in-progress and not yet ready for full deployment.  Please check back soon!
